This is a solution for the [1brc](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) written in Rust.

My goal was to do a low effort implementation and see what results I would get.

At this time the solution achieves around `2.518s` with clean cache and `2.187s` in subsequent runs.

The machine used for testing was a 16 core Ryzen 7950x with 64GB of RAM and a NVMe drive.
